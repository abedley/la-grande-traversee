        <p><span class="newthought">Near the end of September</span>, Evan, Pete and I set off on a 100km journey through Gaspésie National Park. Contrary to our last trip at La Cloche, this trail was unfamiliar to all of us and would be our first adventure in the Gaspé Peninsula.</p>
        <p>The plan was for Evan and I to drive there from Ontario and meet up with Pete who was coming from New Hampshire. Now that we're older and value sleep more we decided to have a travel day and get a hotel near the park, in the town of Matane, before continuing on to the park early the next morning.</p>
