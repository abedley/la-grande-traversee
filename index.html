        <p><span class="newthought">Near the end of September</span>, Evan, Pete and I set off on a 100km journey through Gaspésie National Park. Contrary to our last trip at La Cloche, this trail was unfamiliar to all of us and would be our first adventure in the Gaspé Peninsula.</p>
        <p>The plan was for Evan and I to drive there from Ontario and meet up with Pete who was coming from New Hampshire. We left KW around 5am with Abby, who would be staying with both sets of grandparents over the course of the following week.</p>
        <p>An enjoyable fourteen-hour drive later we arrived in the town of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zbXMwwfJ1h1LHWSq8" target="_blank">Matane</a> just after sunset. We'd be spending the night here close to the park because we needed to catch an early-morning shuttle the following day.</p>
        <p>After a quick reunion at the hotel with Pete we crammed into Pippin<label for="sn-pippin" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-pippin" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Pippin being Pete's red Mini, of course.</span> and went off to find dinner.</p>
