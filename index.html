        <p><span class="newthought">Near the end of September</span>, Evan, Pete and I set off on a 100km journey through Gaspésie National Park. Contrary to our last trip at La Cloche, this trail was unfamiliar to all of us and would be our first adventure in the Gaspé Peninsula.</p>
        <p>The plan was for Evan and I to drive there from Ontario and meet up with Pete who was coming from New Hampshire. We left KW around 5am with Abby, who we would be dropping off in Toronto with the grandparents, before continuing on to Quebec.</p>
        <p>An enjoyable fourteen-hour drive later we arrived in the town of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zbXMwwfJ1h1LHWSq8" target="_blank">Matane</a> just after sunset. We'd be spending the night here close to the park because we needed to catch an early-morning shuttle the following day.</p>
        <p>After a quick reunion at the hotel with Pete we crammed into Pippin<label for="sn-pippin" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-pippin" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Pippin being Pete's red Mini, of course.</span> and went off to find dinner. There was a funny moment right outside the brewpub where none of us wanted to go in first, because that meant you'd have to try and speak French. But it turned out that the wait staff spoke good English so we avoided any abuses of the French language.</p>
        <p>The plan this week was to hike the 100km trail known as La Grande Traversée which spans the width of Gaspésie National<label for="sn-park" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-park" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">All of the provincial parks in Quebec are known as national parks</span> Park. It is also section on the International Appalachian Trail, which is the northern continuation of the much more popular Appalachian Trail.</p>
        <p>The trail is dotted with campsites, alternating between rustic sites with tent platforms, and remote cabins with iron stoves. I'm not a huge fan of sharing a cabin with strangers, and since I booked the trip, we'd be staying at the tent sites for the week.</p>
